# Prerequisites
The below the following programs has to be installed in order to use the application.
1. **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** - The application is developed and designed completely in Python.
2. **[Custom Tkinter](https://pypi.org/project/customtkinter/)** - Application Graphical User Interface (GUI) (module to be installed in python)
3. **[SQL Lite](https://pypi.org/project/pysqlite3/)** - Relational Database in python used for storing data (module to be installed in python)

# Requirement-Engineering
Understanding the requirements for building a software/application is the crucial part of being a software developer. It establishes a solid foundation for the development team to understand the business needs and expectation of users for the application to be built or developed.

**[JIRA](https://hemanthkarthikeyan.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MNYTRKR/boards/2/timeline)** - Used for creating user stories and tasks with requirements for developers 

# Domain-Driven-Design(DDD)
Domain Driven Design (DDD) is the concept of understanding process/ application domains involved in the software related to the business. It defines the problems involved in a particular domain and also further enhances the understanding for the development team. It enhances how the requirements are expressed or organized in software development.

**[Domain-Driven-Design Document](https://github.com/ihemanthkarthik/MoneyTracker/blob/Master/DomainDrivenDesign%20Document.pdf)**

# Unified-Modelling-Language(UML)
Unified Modelling Language is a visual representation of how the software/application works. It helps users understand the workflow of the system both in technical and non-technical terms.

**[Use Case Diagram](https://github.com/ihemanthkarthik/MoneyTracker/blob/Master/UML/User%20Diagram.svg)**

Note: I have just started completed the login module of the application, so I have done the database objects diagram and use case diagram only till the login module.
