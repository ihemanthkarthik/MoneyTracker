# Prerequisites
The below the following programs has to be installed in order to use the application.
1. **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** - The application is developed and designed completely in Python.
2. **[SQL Lite](https://pypi.org/project/pysqlite3/)** - Relational Database in python used for storing data (module to be installed in python)

# Git Repository
The Git Repository is used for version control and cloud storage medium for application

**[GIT](https://github.com/ihemanthkarthik/MoneyTracker/blob/30ad2d3b4b54fe8c2696a948e18721880de1b115/)**

# Requirement-Engineering
Understanding the requirements for building a software/application is the crucial part of being a software developer. It establishes a solid foundation for the development team to understand the business needs and expectation of users for the application to be built or developed.

**[JIRA](https://hemanthkarthikeyan.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MNYTRKR/boards/2/timeline)** - Used for creating user stories and tasks with requirements for developers

# Functional Programming
My Code functionality is not based on the functional programming, but I have added an example of login functionlity implementing the functional programming.


Note: I have just started completed the login module of the application, so I have done the database objects diagram and use case diagram only till the login module.
